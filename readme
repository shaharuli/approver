Description:
This script will approve for you any open MRs that have "totally-human-approved" as a label. With multiple developers running it we can achieve a neverending storm of approvals for our merge requests.
Just run the script on your machine and make sure to label your simple MRs with "totally-human-approved".

All you need to do is run the script once manually and it will add itself to crontab to run every minute
python3 approver.py

The script will generate logs in the same directory where you put it in approver.log
